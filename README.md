# GRawInput
GRawInput is a modification for games "Gothic" and "Gothic 2" that change old deprecated DirectX7 Direct Input Keyboard and Mouse interface over native Windows Events.
It offers a way to enhance your experience with alt-tabbing the game and to make it easier to use ingame overlays like Steam Overlay or ReShade Overlay.
